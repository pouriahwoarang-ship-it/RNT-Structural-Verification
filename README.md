## The Foundational Paradox (تناقضات بنیادی)

This work addresses the structural contradictions inherent in the prevailing Number Theory—contradictions ignored for the sake of preserving the Unique Factorization Theorem (UFD). Our analysis is driven by two fundamental, unanswered questions:

1.  **The Centrality Paradox:** If a prime number is defined solely by its divisibility by $1$ and itself, how can $1$ be excluded? The exclusion of $1$ discards the logical center of the entire number system.
2.  **The Set Integrity Violation:** Excluding $1$ forces the inclusion of $2$ (the only even prime) to save the factorization of all even numbers. This inclusion violates the essential **Oddness** nature of the set, making $2$ a structural anomaly maintained only by utilitarian convention.

This paper demonstrates that reinstating **$1$ to its mechanical fixed-point role** ($R_1(1)=1$) and recognizing the **structural exclusion of $2$** ($R_1(2)=0$) leads to the **mechanical collapse of the Riemann Zeta function mechanism.**

## رویّه علمی (Methodological Stance)

**This project is based purely on mechanical, verifiable algebra. It is not a philosophical debate.**

Any critique, refutation, or counter-claim must be presented **ONLY** in the unambiguous language of **SOLID MATHEMATICS** (e.g., demonstrating a mathematical contradiction in the proofs or verification scripts provided).

**NO response will be given to critiques based on historical convention, philosophical debate, or non-algebraic arguments.** We are here to establish truth, not to preserve existing beliefs.
