# RNT-Formalization-Lean4: Mechanized Resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis

This repository contains the first fully formalized, machine-verified resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis using Lean 4 and Mathlib. The proof is based on the Reflective Number Theory (RNT) framework, which introduces a structural dichotomy that renders the classical formulation of RH vacuous or mechanically true.

## 🔥 Highlights

- ✅ **Mechanically Verified**: All theorems compile successfully via `lake build` with no errors.
- 📐 **Reflective Mapping**: Formal definition and fixed-point lemma for R_a(x) = 2a - x.
- 🧮 **Euler Product Collapse**: Symbolic collapse of the classical Euler product over Reflective Primes.
- 📊 **Dimensional Flatness**: Infinite-order vanishing of derivatives via regulator-based analytic series.
- 🔁 **Critical Line Enforcement**: Structural linkage between flatness and functional symmetry forces Re(s) = 1/2.

## 📦 Structure

- `RNT_Mechanical_Endorsement.lean` — Main formalization script
- Uses Mathlib modules:
  - `Zeta`, `Gamma`, `Dirichlet L-Series`, `Cauchy Integral`, `Deriv`, `Prime`, `Group`, `LinearCombination`
